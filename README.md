This is a chrome extension which creates cold emails on the basis of a job description and your resume.You have to upload your resume and a job description to the extension's popup and it then opens a new tab with the gmail draft ready with the content of the cold email. The server parses the pdf and job description and then gives a prompt to LLAMA-2(7B parameters) which has been hosted on the server using langchain's ollama. The server API's have been created using GIN.
